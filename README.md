Employing artificial intelligence to create models to identify fingerprints with high efficiency, even in cases of deformity, along with the facial recognition system, are included in an 
intermediary system between hospitals and insurance companies that aims to protect health by detecting cases of identity theft that lead to tampering with patients’ medical records and defrauding the companies. 



Abstract:

Insurance companies offer crucial health coverage to the community, streamlining hospital operations. When a patient arrives, the receptionist inquires about their medical insurance. If insured, the patient provides identity, phone, and file numbers for clinic access. Yet, challenges arise due to impersonation, especially in veiled sections, hindering photo-based identification.
To combat this, we propose an advanced solution: a sophisticated fingerprint verification system coupled with cutting-edge facial recognition technology. This system intertwines insurance holders with their records in the hospital's database, mandating fingerprint or facial validation for file access or department entry. The primary aim is to curtail impersonation risks in the women's department, eventually encompassing all patients to minimize fraudulent activities within hospital procedures. The facial recognition element enhances identification accuracy, especially in cases where veils obscure facial features in photos, providing an additional layer of verification for comprehensive security and reliability.


Introduction and Background
Historically and presently, global reliance on hospitals for medical care, albeit at a cost, has been evident. Yet, technological advancements and evolving environments have spurred business expansion, fostering new trades like the insurance sector.
Insurance companies serve as intermediaries between hospitals and the populace. Individuals pay a yearly fee for a card enabling discounted treatment access. Amidst this, concerns linger: Is client data secure? Are patients' rights upheld, including the confidentiality of medical records?
While patient rights are typically safeguarded, attention shifts to protecting the insurance companies themselves. The industry faces potential threats like hacking or fraud, prompting the need for preventive measures and client education on these risks' severity.
Goal
●
Establishing a safe and effective system that acts as an intermediary between the hospital and the insurance company
●
The system works by authenticating with a fingerprint.
●
It provides facial recognition as an alternative authentication system.
Motivation
Through our research, we found that insurance identity theft rates are high in hospitals, which made us think about creating a documentation system that contributes to detecting identity theft and preserving rights.
Signification
The importance of our project is to provide protection and privacy for patients and insurance companies through flexible authentication methods in the system.

Introduction of new requirements might clash with the current architecture.
Cumulative corrections and alterations may lead to the project surpassing the expected timeline.

Report Outline
We started the project by defining the idea, ideas, and purpose of the project. Then we began explaining the problem and creating questionnaires related to the project. Next, the approach and how to manage risks were determined. The project requirements were also determined, and after analyzing the system, work began on designing and implementing it in a practical way to test the user experience and present it to the committee.

Summary
After the goal and purpose of the project mentioned above have been clarified, as well as defining the approach to working on the project, we will continue in the following chapter by clarifying similar applications as well as the core of the problem that exists in them.



the project used Python,Flask and runtime database (Firebase) 
you have to download multiple library for the work of the project
also you have to connect the data here with your own database in firebase
