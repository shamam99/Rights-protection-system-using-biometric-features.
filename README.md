Overview

This project focuses on enhancing security in the healthcare sector by implementing an intermediary system between hospitals and insurance companies. The system employs advanced fingerprint verification and facial recognition technologies to safeguard patient information and prevent identity theft, ultimately contributing to the integrity of healthcare procedures.
Abstract

Identity theft poses a significant challenge in healthcare, especially during interactions between patients, hospitals, and insurance companies. This project proposes an innovative solutionâ€”a comprehensive verification system that intertwines fingerprint and facial recognition technologies. The primary objective is to establish a secure intermediary system, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access and modify patient records.
Introduction and Background

As hospitals play a vital role in providing medical care, insurance companies act as intermediaries, streamlining operations and providing coverage. This project addresses concerns about patient data security, emphasizing the protection of insurance companies from potential threats such as hacking or fraud. The intermediary system aims to authenticate users through fingerprints and facial recognition, enhancing overall healthcare security.
Goal

    Establish a secure and effective intermediary system between hospitals and insurance companies.
    Implement fingerprint authentication and provide facial recognition as an alternative method.

Motivation

High rates of insurance identity theft in hospitals prompted the need for a documentation system to detect identity theft and preserve patient rights. This project aims to contribute to the detection of fraudulent activities and enhance overall healthcare security.
Signification

The importance of this project lies in providing protection and privacy for both patients and insurance companies through flexible and secure authentication methods within the system.
Method

The Agile Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model is employed for its advantages in time-critical applications. It facilitates quick life cycle phases, functional requirement corrections, and risk mitigation. The system's flexibility allows for prompt adjustments and addresses potential risks efficiently.
Report Outline

The project started by defining the idea, understanding the problem, creating questionnaires, managing risks, determining project requirements, and designing and implementing the system. The report outlines a systematic approach to ensure the successful implementation of the healthcare security system.
Summary

After clarifying the project's goal, purpose, and approach, the subsequent chapters will delve into similar applications and the core problems they face. The focus is on providing a comprehensive solution to identity theft within the healthcare sector.
Technology Stack

The project utilizes Python, Flask, and Firebase as a runtime database. Users are required to download multiple libraries for project functionality and connect the data to their own Firebase database.

the project used Python,Flask and runtime database (Firebase) 
you have to download multiple library for the work of the project
also you have to connect the data here with your own database in firebase
